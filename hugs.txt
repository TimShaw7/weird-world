When the days are cold
and the cards aree fold

and the saints we see are all made of gold
when your dreams all fail 
and the ones we hail 
are the worst of all and the blood run stail
I wanna shelter you but with the beast inside 
there's nowhere we can hide.
no matter what we breed, we still are made of greed.
